### How do your donations help us?
We love what we do, and we wish we could achieve everything we think up. The only problem is that everything we need - electronics, lumber, gear boxes, aluminum, polycarbonate, coaching, travel - costs money. That's why we need you; with your donation, we are able to realize our dreams and learn valuable skills.
