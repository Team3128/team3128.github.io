<b>Tax ID 03-0542702</b>.

All of your donations to the Aluminum Narwhals are tax deductible. If you would like more information regarding your donation, you can contact the Executive Director, Joanne Couvrette, at [joanne.couvrette@sduhsd.net](mailto:joanne.couvrette@sduhsd.net) or (858) 350-0253 x4005.

### How do your donations help us?
We love what we do, and we wish we could achieve everything we think up. The only problem is that everything we need - electronics, lumber, gear boxes, aluminum, polycarbonate, coaching, travel - costs money. That's why we need you; with your donation, we are able to realize our dreams and learn valuable skills.
