Welcome to Team 3128's virtual learning program, Narwhal Connections!

Narwhal Connections 2019-2020 was a 6-week-long online elementary and middle school program running from May 8 to June 7, held in lieu of our normal school presentations and outreach events, which were affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During this time, we created a series of physics, robotics, and programming lessons! You can find lessons from each week below.

## **Week 1**
### **Elementary School**
#### Simple Machines 1: Pulleys, Wedges, and Wheels and Axles
Learn about the fundamentals of simple machines, where they're applied in daily life, and design your own simple machine!
