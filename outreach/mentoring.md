Over the years, Team 3128 has mentored a number of FIRST Lego League teams in the community. FIRST Lego League is another branch of the FIRST program intended for students ages 9 through 16.

Previously, members of the Aluminum Narwhals have mentored two local FLL teams:  The Chickeneers and the Pandamoniums. Both teams competed in their regionals and did well; we hope that they can continue to grow and qualify for the World Championships this year!

Looking for FLL mentors? We can help! Please contact [info@team3128.org](mailto:info@team3128.org) with any details.
