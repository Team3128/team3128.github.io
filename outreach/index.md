One of the most important goals we have as a team is to continuously increase the positive impact we have within our community. 

As each year progresses, we have developed a community outreach plan, run by students from our Outreach Committee, that encompasses FIRST's ideals as well as many of our original goals: building a thriving and energetic technology program at our high school, expanding with presentations to local elementary and middle schools, mentoring FLL teams, working with engineering mentors from our corporate sponsors, and emphasizing the importance of responsibility within the STEM community.
