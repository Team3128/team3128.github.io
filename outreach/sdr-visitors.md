## Public Transportation

### Airport to UCSD
There are two main transit links needed to get from the San Diego Airport to the UCSD area.

To get from the airport to a trolley station, the airport provides a free shuttle called the [San Diego Flyer](https://www.san.org/to-from/Public-Transportation#1178347-old-town-shuttle) to Old Town Station. It runs daily from 4:45 AM-12:30 AM every 20-30 minutes.


From the trolley station, take the [Blue Line Trolley](https://www.sdmts.com/getting-around/departures-and-schedules/schedules/510) North. Not all the blue line trolleys go far enough North, so be sure to take one bound for UTC. There are multiple stops around the Southeast side of UCSD with adjoining bus lines. Trolley tickets are $2.50 one-way, and can be purchased at the station or through the [Pronto](https://www.ridepronto.com/) app.

### UCSD Area Transport
A general map of UCSD can be found [here](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=1005#!ce/58845?ct/72246,70460,70457,67878,66728,66558,63891,60907,58479,58109,52803,43513,20079,18027,72348,70462,70461,67879,66730,66559,70459,55127,55129,55130,70458,58027,58097,56492,58029,58030,58031,58032,58033,58034,58036,58028?s/?mc/32.878318765251024,-117.22947295694371?z/15.835940985379608?lvl/0). The transportation section shows campus shuttle stops, MTS trolley stops, and MTS bus stops.
UCSD provides free shuttle service around campus with "[Triton Transit](https://transportation.ucsd.edu/campus/shuttles/index.html)". The Inner Loop and Outer Loop shuttles both stop at the Blue Line Central Campus Trolley station as well as the "RIMAC/Hopkins Parking Structure" near the Liontree Arena.
