# Getting to the San Diego Regional
**Closest Airport**: [San Diego International Airport (SAN)](https://www.san.org/)

**Also**: [Los Angeles International Airport (LAX)](https://www.flylax.com)

## Public Transportation from Airports to UCSD
Sadly, there is no good public transportation from any airport to UCSD/ San Diego Regional.  Renting a car is highly recommended.
Although it is possible to take the Blue Line Trolley from the San Diego Airport to UCSD and some close hotels, it is somewhat complicated (see below).

### San Diego Airport:  Blue Line TROLLEY â†’ TERMINAL Shuttle Service
Passengers can access the **Blue Line Trolley** by taking the Rental Car Shuttles at the transit islands at Terminals 1 and 2. When the driver is notified, the shuttle drops passengers off on the north end of the airport, just one block from the **Middletown Station**. Passengers proceed by crossing Pacific Highway and walking one block northeast on W. Palm Street to the **Middletown Station** on the left.
