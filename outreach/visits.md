Every year, the Aluminum Narwhals attend different schools in San Diego county to present and demonstrate the yearâ€™s competition robot to elementary and middle school students. In presenting, we aim to promote the ideals and goals of the FIRST program, encouraging schools to establish or support their own FIRST teams and STEM programs.

Many students also retain the misconception throughout their entire school career that robotics and STEM in general is all math-related; we want to correct this misunderstanding and hence encourage the students at these schools to go on and pursue the sciences in high school and beyond. Thruogh these presentations, we can bring STEM right to their doorstep and open up a whole new perspective.

School presentations generally occur in the last few months of school. To schedule or inquire about a presentation, please contact [info@team3128.org](mailto:info@team3128.org).
