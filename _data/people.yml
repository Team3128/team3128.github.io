  blurb: Priyanka is a senior and been a member of the controls department since she was a freshman. She began in both marketing and controls, but after learning how to strip and connect wires one day in the workshop, she transitioned fully to controls in hopes of learning more about robot code as well as wiring. Priyanka makes executive electrical decisions regarding the robot(s), as well as answering questions about and teaching the ins and outs of wiring to her fellow members. She also helps with the programming of the robot, and has coded multiple subsystems. At competitions, she mostly troubleshoots hardware issues, dabbling in potential logic issues in the code as well. In her free time, Priyanka loves watching the sunrise, writing, and working out.
