Hi all! 

It is with great regret I inform y'all so early in the morning that the San Diego Regional (3/11-3/14) has been postponed to an unknown date.

Due to the prevalence of coronavirus, it has been highly recommended by the state of California that all gatherings of 250+ individuals be postponed or cancelled. FIRST HQ has decided to pursue this recommendation; thus, at 6:30 this morning, a notice was sent out from FIRST to our mentor, Chris Low:

    Good Morning FRC Team Leaders,
    I am writing to share hugely disheartening news that as a result of the quickly evolving COVID-19 situation and the California    Governor’s announcement of new guidelines released by the California Public Health Department that large gatherings over 250 people should be postponed or canceled, we have made the decision with leadership at FIRST Headquarters to postpone the San Diego Regional effective immediately.
    California Health Department Policy: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Gathering_Guidance_03.11.20.pdf
    We are disappointed that teams will not have a chance to compete this weekend and we recognize there will be many questions about how this will affect the remainder of the season, yet the health and safety of our teams, volunteers and community are top priority. The new dates for the San Diego Regional have not yet been set, but we are working closely with FIRST Headquarters to determine next steps. As soon as we have more details, we will share.
    For teams that have already loaded in, we ask that you begin a safe load out this morning with 5 team members. If your team has not loaded in yet, you do not need to come as you won’t be admitted into the event.
    This is a dynamically changing situation, and we greatly appreciate your understanding and gracious professionalism during these uncertain and challenging times.
    Thank you so much!

Of course, the health and safety of our team members far outweighs the importance of competition. Although it is unfortunate that our events are likely to be cancelled and that this will mark the beginning of the end of the season for Team 3128, the experience that we've gained is invaluable and irreplaceable. We will continue to work on our robot, even if we will not have another chance to compete on the official field.

The DMR Post-Mortem, temporarily on hold for edits, will be available soon.
