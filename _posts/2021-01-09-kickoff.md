Greetings friends!

Just as a quick introduction, my name is Cynthia L., and I am a part of the mechanical department. Today we welcomed 2021's Infinite Recharge at Home! The Narwhals are back at it again to tackle a very strange build season, starting the day off with the FIRST Twitch stream, impatiently waiting for the password required to unlock the game manual. After absorbing all of the content within it, the rest of the day was filled with discussions, Kahoots, and other wonderful things. Here's a quick recap of what all the departments have been up to! 

**Mechanical**
Today, the Mechanical Department determined the overall course we wanted the robot to take, and split up into sub-system groups. Those groups then roughed out an idea for how their sub-system will function.  The groups also created designs of prototypes to test their new ideas, to be built and experimented with over the coming week. The whole department then met to coordinate on how to unify these mechanisms into a cohesive whole.

**Strategy**
Today at Kickoff, Strat has quickly read the Infinite Recharge at Home game manual and created a kahoot to test the team on the just dropped game manual with the entire team! After lunch, Strat reconvened in our breakout rooms to discuss our direction for build season. We decided to put all our focus on the Game Design Challenge this year and so, we worked on the game design activities to gain insight into designing our game.

That's all the news we have regarding Kickoffs! We wish you all an amazing build season, and we can't wait to see what the next few months will bring!
