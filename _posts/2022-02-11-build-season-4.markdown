Salutations water-dwelling-horned mammals!
<br>
WOOHOO, we are almost done with build season! The narwhals are pratically living in the workshop at this point, making final adjustments to our robot (name impending...). It's been almost two weeks since our last update, so let's check in with our departments!
<br>

**Business**
<br>
Business has turned to awards writing this past week after finishing with some grants and newsletters. The Woodie Flowers Finalist Award was submitted this week, and members have worked hard to finish it. Both veterans and new members have completed the draft of the Entrepreneurship Award, and we will be moving on to editing next week as the first regional competition approaches.

**Controls**
<br>
Controls is busy putting the final touches on the competition robot. We spent some more time wiring and organizing wires in the robot this past week. We have also further tested more subsystems on the robot; the intake, hopper, shooter, and climber have all been tested to some extent. Finally, we have been able to test some of our autonomous routines.

**Strategy**
<br>
We have finished our game simulations and taught members from other departments about pit scouting guidelines at competition. We are now working on pre scouting teams at upcoming competitions.

**Mechanical**
<br>
In week 5, Mechanical worked on finishing touches for the robot, and improvements that will be added later in the season. Our climber was rebuilt to be sturdier and more reliable. We also are working on making an adjustable hood shooter that will be added to the robot sometime after PHR and a hopper gate that will allow the robot to hold two balls more easily. Weâ€™ve begun work on our design for the pit this year, which should make us more productive and organized and productive at competitions.

**Marketing**
<br>
For Week 5 of  build season, Marketing has finalized the base meal plan for the Port Hueneme regional. We have also continued making buttons with the help of some peeps from other departments. We are continuing to do Senior Spotlight to honor all of our seniors who will sadly be leaving us this year.

Welp, that's all for this update. We are so excited to be participating in Port Hueneme Regionals in less than two weeks! Bye for now!
