Howdy funky fresh metal friends!
<br>
Oh boy has it been a busy 2 weeks (hence the joint week 3 and 4 blog post). The robot is technically complete, quite the milestone if I do say so myself. Quite a lot has happened since our last update, so let's see what our departments have been up to in the past two weeks.
<br>

**Business**
<br>
As Build Season continues, the Business Department has progressed with grants and begun Awards writing. Both veterans and new members have completed two reports necessary for the Sony Grant and have submitted the grant last week. Business is also working on awards for the season. Members are drafting the Entrepreneurship Award, which demonstrates our teamâ€™s comprehensive business plan for sustainability.

**Controls**
<br>
Controls has been busy with all sorts of things these past two weeks. We created and tuned a custom pipeline for tracking cargo on the field, which will be helpful for the drive team when implemented with the competition robot. More recently, we have been at work wiring the entire competition robot, and testing the different subsystems as they are mechanically integrated. Finally, we have been doing some interpolation on the shooter to relate distance and RPM

**Strategy**
<br>
After completing our game simulations and reflecting on them to better understand Rapid React strategies, we dedicated more effort to preparing for competition by developing our pitscouting system further. We have developed questions and a form for pit scouting and have practiced with different departments on our team.

**Mechanical**
<br>
After we finished our complete design, Mechanical shifted to manufacturing and assembling the robot. The majority of the robot was machined in week 3 and assembled in week 4. Once the robot was mostly assembled, we handed it over to controls for wiring. The climber was assembled at the end of week 4, and is the only subsystem that hasn't been integrated with the robot. Going into week 5 we will finish integration of all subsystems with the robot and continue working on robot improvements. Currently, we plan to add a gate to control when balls can exit the hopper and enter the shooter, and a shooter with an adjustable hood angle.

**Marketing**
<br>
For week 3 and 4 of build season, Marketing has officially ordered the team T-shirts and have designed the buttons and begun the process of making buttons. In addition, we have created the meal plan for the Port Hueneme Regional. The team avatar is finished with sponsor banner quotes. Finally, Senior Spotlights are going well along with our new TikTok account @3128aluminumnarwhals.

We still have a lot to do before Port Hueneme, so au revoir for now!
