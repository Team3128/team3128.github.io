Hello friends!
Here’s a little introduction about me. My name is Emma C. I am head of the Marketing department, and I am a member of the class of 2023. I will be doing weekly updates on what each department has done in the past week. Enough of introductions, let’s get into robotics!! 
We are onto our second week of build season with the new game Rapid React that is sponsored by Boeing with a theme of transportation. All departments have been very busy strategizing and prototyping for the new game and robot. Here is an update on each of the departments:
<br>

**Business**
<br>
In the past week, the Business Department has continued working on newsletters and writing grants that have opened up this month. New members have published the Offseason Newsletter and sent it to our sponsors, as well as interviewed members for the Kickoff Newsletter. In addition to submitting the Brain Corp Grant, both veterans and new members have been working diligently to edit and finalize the Sony Grant as we prepare to submit it in the following days.

**Controls**
<br>
This past week, controls has been hard at work prototyping and experimenting with autonomous and computer-vision-related affairs. After watching the kickoff stream and understanding the game for the year, we got to work prototyping the subsystems with the mechanical department. As more final, motor-controlled prototypes were fabricated, we used our testbench in order to run motors and gauge the effectiveness of the prototype. Additionally, with the auto priority list from strategy, we started planning out some of our autos and testing them on a different drivetrain. Finally, we have been experimenting with the new vision target for this year and using a custom pipeline to track the cargo balls.

**Strategy**
<br>
On the day of kickoff, we started by making a Kahoot to make sure the entire team understood this year’s game, then we made a priority list that explained which robot capabilities were most important to focus on this year and presented it to Mech. We also made an auto priority list describing the most important auto plants this year and presented it to controls. Then, we worked on analyzing the game. We thought about what robots we might see at competition and how we might work with them. This, along with general tips for strategy and drivers was included in our driver-guide. We also worked on adjusting our e-scouting system and database to this game. We also worked on an updated pit scouting system for competition.

**Mechanical**
<br>
The majority of mechanics have been spending the week prototyping. Starting at kickoff, mech members read the rulebook and came up with overall sketches for what the robot would look like. After the department agreed on what the broad subsystems would be from these rough sketches (drivetrain, intake, hopper, shooter, climber), we made cardboard mockups of what different versions of these systems could look like. From there, we narrowed down our concepts to one or two per subsystem and made more functional prototypes. The rest of the week, we iterated on these prototypes, bringing them closer to their final form. In the last couple of days, we also roughed out what the robot will look like in CAD (called Crayola CAD). This rough draft allows us to finalize the size of the robot, and move forward with final designs. Alongside the prototype, we also assembled the chassis kit we received from FIRST, and made bumpers for it.

**Marketing**
<br>
The marketing department has been working on the new T-shirt design based on the theme of the game this year of transportation. We have many designs in the running but a Narplane looks like it is the team favorite. We have also been working with Chris L. on the travel logistics of Port Hueneme including buses and food options/menus. This week we secured our order of narwhal lanyards, which should come before the first regional. In addition to lanyards, we have begun sewing training for making narwhal horns for judges and fans at regionals. This coming week our main goal is to finalize the logo for the T-shirt and order them in time for the regional Port Hueneme.

So far, our departments have been working hard to get a head start on this year’s build season. We are ecstatic to play the new Rapid React game and look forward to improving the robot. That’s all for now, **Go Narwhals!**
