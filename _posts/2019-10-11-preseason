School has been in full swing for over a month now, and so has Team 3128! We kicked off the new school year with an offseason competition at Los Angeles Fleet Week and our annual Narwhal Intro Day, during which prospective narwhals showed up at the workshop to find out what FIRST robotics is about and what our team is like. Intro Day was followed by NarWeek; every day, a different department gave an in-depth presentation on who they are what what their tasks are over the course of the year.

This year, our Controls and Mechanical/Construction departments received a huge influx of new members, and they are now at capacity! However, for students still interested in joining the team, keep in mind that our other three departments (Marketing, Business, and Strategy) are still available. Simply contact one of our mentors or email info@team3128.org for more information on how to join the team later in the school year.

Of course, there was a lot of "administrivia," but now that the dust has settled, both new and veteran narwhals alike are delving deep into their projects.

Mechanical has begun training students in using the power tools and computer aided design (CAD) software, while Controls has been teaching new narwhals about control theory and electrical amongst other things.

Business and Marketing have also been at work getting their new members situated, from learning how to apply for grants to experimenting with Inkscape and Adobe Illustrator.

Strategy is busy working with new members on (this is enough text)
