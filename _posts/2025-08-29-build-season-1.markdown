Welcome back, parents and sponsors! 
<br>
After a well-deserved summer break and an exciting week of recruitment, the Narwhals are thrilled to announce the finalized roster for the 2025–2026 season, now filled with talented and enthusiastic new members. Over the summer, the team stayed busy hosting our annual summer camp, where students in grades 1–9 engaged in a week-long, hands-on experience exploring the world of STEM. In addition to mentoring young minds, the team has been hard at work with summer projects, laying the groundwork for a strong and impactful season.

**Business**
<br>
In August, the Business and Marketing department brought energy and creativity by launching a series of engaging campaigns that successfully promoted Intro Day and Narweek. These efforts included captivating reels, posts, stories, and posters that showcased our team’s enthusiastic culture and spirit. Building on that, they also introduced each department through thoughtful spotlights, helping new members feel both welcomed and informed. A series of student leadership posts was created as well to celebrate individual dedication and express the team’s appreciation. Finally, nearing the end of the month, the department worked behind the scenes to craft the team newsletter, ensuring clear and consistent communication with the public. Alongside these activities, the department saw great success during recruitment. During Narweek, they facilitated fun, interactive icebreakers that sparked conversation and connection, setting the stage for an engaging season.

**Controls**
<br>
This August, the Controls department took part in a mix of hands-on and team-building tasks. They began by tackling robot wiring, a process that connects electrical components to ensure smooth communication between sensors and motors. To support this, they built and refined a testbench: a simplified robot platform designed specifically to test individual parts like motors and sensors before integrating them into the full system. Battery testing was also a priority, especially since it requires constant monitoring and maintenance to stay safe and reliable. Beyond the technical work, the team welcomed new members with energy and enthusiasm. During Narweek, they organized interactive activities such as a tool usage card-sorting games to introduce the robot’s autonomous systems. These collaborative challenges showcased the team’s technical skills and the power of teamwork. The Controls department made August a month of both progress and connection.

**Strategy**
<br>
The Strategy department made significant advancements this month in their scouting systems and department development. To begin, they made preparations to film new episodes for Narwhal Network: a video-based series that explores robotics and strategy topics—from offseason predictions to the department’s behind-the-scenes insights. The department also enhanced several scouting tools, including Neptune, our competition data analysis app, which now supports mobile devices for greater flexibility. They also created Orca; an offline pit scouting app designed to streamline team interviews at competitions; and launched FantasyFIRST, a creative new project that reimagines fantasy football for the world of FRC Robotics. Alongside these innovations, the department had an engaging Newark Day, featuring drive coach practice, strategy-based games, and engaging presentations that built both excitement, relationships, and skills.

**Mechanical**
<br>
The Mechanical Department has made significant progress this month, starting with the completion of CAD designs for both the main robot Gillout and the Junior Bot using Onshape, a computer-aided design program that allows us to digitally model our robots before manufacturing. Gillout is currently in the process of being built, with major subsystems like the pivot and manipulator nearly finished. Beyond the robot, the department has constructed a new superpit for the Control Department to enhance organization in addition to completing a custom Omio CNC enclosure to improve the structure and safety around the team’s CNC cutting machine. The department also welcomed new members through successful Narweek and Intro Day events, where participants tackled design challenges, learned about the game concept, and got hands-on experience with essential tools and machines.

**Intro Day and Narweek**
<br>
Intro Day and Narweek are key onboarding events designed to introduce new members to our team and the broader FRC community. Intro Day serves as a general overview, where incoming students learn about our mission, the structure of FRC, and the various departments within our team. After a group presentation, students rotated through department-led activities to get a basic, hands-on feel for each area, helping them identify where their interests might lie. Afterwards, Narweek helped build on this foundation by diving deeper into each department, with designated days for specific activities and lectures that showcased each group's role on the team. Following Narweek, interested students submitted a form ranking their preferred departments followed by interviews the next day. Leading up to these events, the team’s Business and Marketing department created and distributed flyers to incoming freshmen and sophomores to boost interest and engagement. Looking ahead, we’re excited to begin working with the new recruits and see how they will grow within the team.
