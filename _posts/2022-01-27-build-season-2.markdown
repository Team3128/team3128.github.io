Hey y'all,

Build Season is in full swing! Currently, we are finalizing designs and starting to manufacture. Without further ado, here's a few words from each of our departments!
<br>

**Business**
<br>
As Build Season progresses, the Business Department has finished writing and designing the Kickoff Newsletter. New members have published it, summarizing each departments' achievements and activities on Kickoff Day, and sent it to our sponsors. Both veterans and new members have been working on the Sony Grant to finish up two reports needed by the grant and to gather documents necessary for submission. Beyond newsletters and grants, Business is beginning to work on awards for the season. In the following weeks, both veterans and new members will turn their attention to begin drafting for the Entrepreneurship Award.

**Controls**
<br>
Controls has been busy developing code for this yearâ€™s robot! We have code set up to test on the competition robot once the mechanical department finishes manufacturing. We have also further worked on autonomous cargo tracking capability on our robot. Autonomous programs are in pretty good shape as well. Finally, we have begun to wire the competition robot as parts of it finish manufacturing.

**Strategy**
<br>
We have continued working on our analysis of the game by looking into game simulations and preparing scouting systems for competition. Last weekend, we did our human game, which is a way we simulate the game at full scale, using people as robots! We have also begun our paper game simulation. For scouting, we have finished developing the first draft of our escouting application. We are also developing a framework for pitscouting at competiton.

**Mechanical**
<br>
All subsystems are finished and demonstrated working prototypes. The robot drivetrain finished assembly, and was handed off to controls for wiring. With the prototypes done, mechanical mostly spent the week making final designs in CAD. We updated the sketches made last week to exact 2d versions of the final robot. Using these sketches as a base, we made the robot in 3d. After each subsystem was made, they had to work together to integrate these systems into a full robot. We were able to spot many issues with colliding parts and design issues in the CAD, and resolved it. Going into week 3, we now have an almost complete design with only a few parts missing. That will allow us to begin our most intense phase of manufacturing shortly.

**Marketing**
<br>
This week Marketing finalized the Narplane logo for the Rapid React themed team T-shirts. In addition, we confirmed the contract with team Paradox at SDA for the buses to the Port Hueneme regional. We have also started a new project of Senior Spotlight that highlights the hard work and achievements of each senior on Team 3128. Finally, the sponsor banner design is almost done and is planned to be ordered this weekend along with buttons!

Well that's all for this week! Stay tuned for more build season updates!
