After a long day of practice matches, it was finally time for the first official competition day of Del Mar Regional! 

During practice matches yesterday, we ran into a multitude of problems, so our first priority this morning was to resolve those issues. Thankfully, the majority of our difficulties were solved yesterday; however, the controls department had trouble fixing vision and autonomous programs, a problem that lingered throughout the day. We still continued to work hard to do our best in the qualification matches.

Our first qualification match was a disaster. During the autonomous period, our robot would not move at all. During teleop, we didn't score a single power cell point. Towards the end, we switched to playing defense, but our robot got intertwined with our opponent's robot, which affected our endgame. We were crushed by a score of 88-35.

We quickly identified the problems and tried our best to solve the issues. Our next match, qualification 18, went a lot better. Although we still could not get our auto to work, we were able to score a few power cell points during teleop. In the endgame, we were able to hang with our alliance partner, the [Leodroids](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/4919/2020). Our alliance won 105-70.

The mechanical and controls department continued to work hard to solve our ongoing problems and fix other parts. Sadly, our autonomous program could not work properly which affected our ability to score points during the auto period. Even teleop was not going our way, as it was difficult to and support our alliance partners. One thing that was continuously working was our ability to hang, which helped us rack up points in the endgame.

We also held a raffle with the prize being a custom made narwhal horn! Teams could enter by stopping by our pit to color a narwhal coloring sheet. We had a total of 3 winners, coming from 3 teams: [Leodroids](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/4919/2020), [TCATs](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/5526), and [Team Rewind](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/4419).

Overall, the day did not go well for us, since we ended the day with a rank of 56 out of 58 teams. However, we were still able to solve a few problems, and we still look forward to getting much more accomplished for day 3!

See you!
