Hello friends of Team 3128!
<img src="/assets/Day_2.jpg" class="rightimage">
Day 2 of Build season - after surviving Day 1, the Team returned to the CCA workshop to begin prototyping and discussing strategies.

Software discussed auto vs driving blind vs vision systems.  Mechanical worked on a proto bot for testing (and outreach - look, it can fit in a car, unlike "Guido" of 2018).

Much discussion of making hatch covers vs just buying them... after a little cost comparison, we bought.  It certainly helped that we had JUST discovered our Business Division had landed a Title Sponsor!! This is BIG $$, absolutely crucial to the team's success, so we were riding high all day.  Kudo's to Zoe C and her Business Team, and THANK YOU to the San Diego Legion Rugby Team! (Pretty sure we are the first robotics team ever to be sponsored by a U.S. Professional rugby team!

And Thanks to our wonderful Team parents - lunch arrived, keeping our blood sugar high for the rest of the day!  

Thank you to our fabulous mentor Denise Gibbs for bringing breakfast on Kickoff, and Thanks to the Piccioni family and Anja Koester for lunch on Kickoff day.

Thank you to the Fuller family and the Soin family for lunch Sunday.  And thanks again to Denise Gibbs for donating a fridge - all the leftovers will be consumed during the week, we promise.

And finally, a visit from Natalee's dog Blu.  Just not in the workshop (metal shavings).

Stay tuned for updates!
