Hello friends of Team 3128!  We are deep into the Deep Space challenge.  
<br>
No panic yet, that is to come...
<br>
<br>
Prototyping, brainstorming, learning the game manual - oh my.
<br>
What are the max points possible? (154)  
<br>
Can we climb from Hab level to Platform 3? 
<br>
Can ANYONE?  How?
<br>
<br>

Mechs worked on a practice bot, alums visited, taught, built things. 
<br>
<br>
Intakes and elevators were drawn, discussed, discarded, drawn again. 
<br>
<br>
Hatch pickup and placement systems were evaluated. 
<br>
<br>
Game pieces were ordered, materials were evaluated, Home Depot was raided by alums and mentors.  
<br>
<br>

The sound of saws and hammers from the construction team. 
<br>
<br>
The smell of sawdust.
<br>
<br>
Videos of robots climbing stairs were studied from youtube and Ri3d.
<br>
<br>
Coders coded.  
<br>
What to do during Sandstorm... auto? Vision system?  Drive blind??
<br>

It rained! (This is a Big Deal in San Diego)
<br>
<br>
<br>
The ONE thing we've learned - nothing happens when the Team is hangry.  
<br>
To our providers of Food - we are forever grateful!
<br>
Sunday Lunch was provided on Sunday by the Fuller and Soin families - thank you!! So much appreciated!
<br>
Mentor Denise Gibbs was again the savior by bringing in an old dorm fridge for our leftovers.  
<br>
The Monday afterschool team was HAPPY to help clear out that fridge.

A solid 9 hours on Saturday, 6 hours on Sunday... things are coming together. 
A plan is being formulated.  Backordered items are being re-ordered.  
A "blind" texture test of the real expensive HDPE hab covering vs. a possible cheaper alternative is planned...
