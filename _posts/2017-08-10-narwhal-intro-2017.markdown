Mark you calendars, because the school year is approaching quickly, and we are proud to announce this year's Narwhal Intro Day!

The first official FRC meeting of this year is Wednesday, September 6, 2017. On Narwhal Intro Day, new members will get a chance to be introduced to our team and what we do, as well as hear from each of our 6 departments (Strategy, Business & Submissions, Mechanical, Construction, Controls), where they will talk about all of the awesome stuff they do during the ye
ar. This is the perfect opportunity to learn about what it means to be a Narwhal. Get a running start this year and join our family!

Are you as excited as we are? Head over to the [students page](/students/) to learn how to become involved!
