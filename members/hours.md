Tracking the time you spend at the workshop is important. Not only is having record of all your hard work and dedication a great college application point, but privileges like eligibilty for our leadership team and competition team all require certain minimum hour requirements. In order to keep track of your hours, follow these steps:
+ When you come to the workshop each day, sign in on the automatic time tracking terminal with your student ID card.
+ Before you leave the workshop, make sure to sign out.

If you forget your student ID card, you may log hours manually using the [FRC Workshop Time Log form](/assets/documents/FRCWorkshopTimeLog.pdf). However, you may log a *maximum of 20 hours* using this method, so please don't forget your ID!
