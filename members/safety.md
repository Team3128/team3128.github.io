We work with a lot of cool tools and hardware on our team, and while these enable us to be able to create awesome things, they also pose a risk if not used properly. In order to ensure that we can continue pursuing our wildest dreams and craziest ambitions, we require all members to complete basic safety training.

## Safety Training
Note that these steps do not allow you to start using power tools, but these are **required** for entry and use of the workshop. 
<!--Returning members must complete training **by September 7th, 2020** and new members must complete training **by October 9th, 2020**.
