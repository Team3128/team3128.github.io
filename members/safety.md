We work with a lot of cool tools and hardware on our team, and while these enable us to be able to create awesome things, they also pose a risk if not used properly. In order to ensure that we can continue pursuing our wildest dreams and craziest ambitions, we require all members to complete basic safety training.

## Safety Training
Note that these steps do not allow you to start using power tools, but these are **required** for entry and use of the workshop after **October 11th, 2019**.

1. Review the [FIRST 2019 Safety Manual](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/frc/team-resources/safety/2019/2019-first-robotics-competition-safety-manual.pdf)
2. Review the [Team 3128 Workshop Safety Rules](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WzseSUYmA87MJyWdK_2qxU6KtszhGB_BVom2Pd1KJIc/edit?usp=sharing)
3. Review the [Team 3128 Safety Training presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cnqgLITAl1oYR-0wUrQnWW-KW24i0vJtbf5vgKbBTK0/edit#slide=id.g4266068401_3_70)
4. View the following 7 minute [Safety Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fivMiePNjCc) on YouTube
5. Take the [Team 3128 Safety Quiz](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1sdSVzq1JRzRwxsA9ClK9YCC21OyEwDfI5OaDP3UFXuQ/viewform?edit_requested=true). To complete Safety Training, you must pass this quiz with a score of 85% or higher.

## So you want to use power tools?
<!--If you have completed all the steps above but are interested in joining Mechanical (or Construction) or Controls (electrical and software), you will need to view the following presentations and complete their corresponding quizzes.-->

Our Mechanical and Controls departments have reached capacity for the 2019-2020 season, but their respective safety presentations can be found below. If you still need to complete the Mechanical or Controls safety quizzes, contact [Chris Low](mailto:chris@team3128.org).
