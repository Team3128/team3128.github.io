<!--- ### **How to Join the FRC Robotics Team**
<br>
Team 3128 “The Aluminum Narwhals” accepts applications in early Fall only.  Our Robotics recruitment event is called “Narweek”.  

Narweek begins with **Intro Day** on **Friday August 26, at 3:30 PM in the robotics workshop.**  Each of our five departments (Mechanical, Controls, Business, Marketing, and Strategy) will be giving a brief introduction of what they do, and answer questions.

Starting on Monday August 29, our workshop will open every day at 3:30 PM.  Each department will present on a specific day:
- Monday Aug. 29 – Mechanical 
- Tuesday Aug. 30 – Controls
- Wednesday Aug. 31 – Business
- Thursday Sept. 1 – Marketing
- Friday Sept. 2 – Strategy

When you apply to the Team, you may apply to 2 departments.  You MUST attend those departments presentation days to be considered. 

For example – if you are most interested in Marketing and Strategy, you **must** attend Thursday (Marketing) and Friday (Strategy) of Narweek. 

**To join Team 3128:**
- Be a current student at CCA
- Attend **Intro Day** on **August 26th at 3:30pm in the Robotics Workshop**
- Attend **Narweek (Aug 29 – Sept. 2)** for the departments that interest you
    - To join any department, you must have attended their Narweek presentation day.
- Be sure you can meet the time commitment
- **Fill out an application**, choosing your top 2 departments

Team member applications and selection are complete for the 2022-2023 school year. 
We had many more applicants than spots available, and selection was extremely difficult. <br>

If you applied, emails with acceptance/rejection will be sent out at 5:00 PM on **Sunday, Sept. 4, 2022**. <br>

If you applied, but did not receive an email response on Sept. 4 - please contact the Team at [info@team3128.org](mailto:info@team3128.org). <br>

If you received an acceptance email, it included instructions for items that must be completed by **Wednesday Sept. 7, 2022 at 8 PM**, to be rostered with the Team. 
If any prospective member fails to complete rostering by that date, we will assume they are no longer interested, and move on to any waitlisted candidates.

<!--
To become part of the team, simply follow the steps below:
-->

<!--1. **Stop by the workshop!** For new members who would like to join in the Fall, you can [contact us](/contact/) or stop by our workshop and talk to one of our [student leaders](/about/leaders/). We'll introduce you to our five departments (Mechanical, Controls, Business, Marketing, and Strategy), and the department heads will be able to get you started with classes and projects.
-->

<!-- 1. **Sign up on our [team roster](https://team3128.us17.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=7c13b1f47db9b4f3392eda9f2&id=b93cada25a).** This will get you added to our mailing list so you know everything that is going on.  Please use an email you check regularly.
2. **Review the [Team 3128 Handbook](/resources/Team3128Handbook.pdf).** The handbook contains information on the basics of what our team does, the code of conduct, team information for parents, build season, etc. You will also need both you and your parent to sign the "Code of Conduct Agreement" page, located on the second page of the same document as the Parental Consent & Waiver (see Step 5).
<!--4. **Turn in a [Safety Waiver](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hleaX1rEWXA9QjJedI54hGureuK_zdqZQUVaP21OPQM/edit?usp=sharing).** You and your parental unit will need to read, understand, agree to, and sign the safety waiver. Please turn in the physical waiver to a mentor at the workshop.
-->
<!-- 3. **Complete [Team 3128 Safety Training](/members/safety/).** Because of the nature of what we do, safety is paramount to our team. That's why we require all members to complete safety training and take the safety quiz. -->
<!--
That's why we require all returning members to complete safety training by **September 7th, 2020** and all new members to complete it by **October 9th, 2020.**
-->
<!-- 4. **Sign up on [STIMS](https://my.firstinspires.org/Dashboard/), our league information manager, by January 9, 2021.** This will let you attend tournaments and be involved in official robotics events off-campus. *This step requires a parental unit to finish.* You can find detailed instructions for [new members here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4NhnLtlTNV6T1ljM0o2Wm9wc28/view) and [returning members here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4NhnLtlTNV6WGR2Rzk5NXpNbzQ/view). 
<!-- The Consent and Release Form, which must be signed to complete STIMS, has changed this year due to COVID-19! Please make sure to read the form carefully, **and have your parental unit read it carefully too.** -->
<!-- As a new requirement this year, **all youth team members must register** in order to participate in any remote or in-person FIRST activities.
5. **Turn in the [Parental Consent & Waiver for 2020-2021](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UjWkqNu8Vob1p9chxhx3HSveeSVW7P9wvv6B3R-iq3k/edit#heading=h.5fghb1f5uj25).** You and your parental unit must read, understand, agree to, and sign the waiver. Once it's been signed, upload both pages to [this form](https://forms.gle/pN9pfaW34BWTHCWeA). 
<!--
*CCA has a "**[Health & Safety Agreement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10I9Qjs45YUul7zUiLoQeGjVue881V42e/view?usp=sharing)**" that your parental unit will eventually need to sign and submit as a scanned document. As part of the agreement, you must also review [SDUHSD Reopening Information](https://www.sduhsd.net/Departments/Administrative-Services/Health-Services/Covid-19-Resources/index.html). However, because reopening procedures are subject to change, we are not requiring it at this point in time. Additional steps may have to be followed depending on how reopening proceeds.*
-->

<!-- That's it! If you have any questions, feel free to reach out and contact our [coaches and leaders](/contact/).   -->

<!--After that, the only thing left to do is to show up! You can also check out our [calendar](/members/calendar/) and [blog updates](/blog/) to find out about all the things happening in robotics. You can also [email our leaders](/contact/) to ask any questions you may have.
-->

**Acceptance criteria for Team 3128:** 
- Willingness to learn
- Enthusiasm
- Ability to communicate
- Ability to remain calm under pressure
- Ability to work with other students as a team
- Time available to meet the commitments of the Robotics competition season 

These were the primary criteria we will use to rank applicants. Prior robotics experience is certainly helpful, but not required. Each [department](/about/departments/) has a certain number of available spots, and applicants will be given these spots (based on their ranking) until the department slate is full.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact our [student leaders](/about/leaders/) or email info@team3128.org for more information!

Please do NOT use your student email (xxxx@my.sduhsd.net) to contact Team 3128. Your school email rejects all emails from outside the school, so we cannot reply or contact you.

### Finding the Workshop
Our Workshop is located right under the Learning Commons. There are two ways to get to our workshop:
1. **From the school.** Take the stairs between the B building and the Learning Commons towards the Admin Parking Lot. Our workshop is just past the Nest on the right side of the gate (the fenced-in area).
2. **From the Admin Parking Lot** Our workshop can be accessed by entering the large concrete sidewalk just right of the Administration building. It is the fenced-in area.
