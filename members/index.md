Becoming a part of robotics is very easy. There are just a few steps:

<!--
Uncomment this portion near the end of the school year.
1. **Come to Narwhal Orientation.** On Narwhal Intro Day, each of our five divisons (Mechanical, Controls, Business, Marketing, and Strategy) will be giving a brief introduction of what they do, and on Narwhal Information Days, eahc division will be giving a presentation to orient and acquaint new members, describe the work they do, how to join, and what training they will have available to get you started. Check out our [calendar](/members/calendar/) for dates and details.
-->
1. **Attend a Narwhal Workshop Tour.** For new members who would like to join in the Fall, we host workshop tours every Friday that are led by our team's student leadership. These workshop tours allow new students to be introduced to our team and our departments, as well as learn more about how to get started participating in the team.
2. **Sign up on our [team roster](https://team3128.us17.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=7c13b1f47db9b4f3392eda9f2&id=b93cada25a).** This will get you added to our mailing list so you know everything that is going on.  Please use an email you check regularly.
3. **Sign up on [STIMS](https://my.firstinspires.org/Dashboard/), our league information manager.** This will let you attend tournaments and be involved in official robotics events off-campus. *This step requires a parental unit to finish.*
4. **Turn in a [Safety Waiver](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eKfQ-ij7vUV6zmvRvK-UCNH1psCDn2Wk-KJHHpBW6ec/edit?usp=sharing).** You and your parental unit will need to read, understand, agree to, and sign the safety waiver. Please turn in the physical waiver to a mentor at the workshop.
5. **Complete [Team 3128 Safety Training](/members/safety/).** Because of the nature of what we do, safety is paramount to our team. That's why we require all members to complete safety training **before Sept. 26, 2018**; after this date, no entry will be granted into the workshop unless you complete safety training.

After that, the only thing left to do is to show up! We meet at the Robotics Workshop, which is located right under the Learning Commons and just past the Nest (it's somewhat hard to miss, with the robots, the stacks of wood, and all of us). This year, we're meeting 5 days a week right after school. You can check out our [calendar](/members/calendar/) and [blog updates](/blog/) to find out about all the things happening in robotics. You can also [email our leaders](/contact/) to ask any questions you may have.

## Growing Your Skills

After youâ€™ve signed up, there are lots of different ways to grow your skills:

**Learn your way around the workshop.** Through various talks and hands-on explanations, mentors and students explain how to use various tools and the various procedures of the team.  
**Attend Workshops and Classes,** Throughout preseason, our members and mentors will be giving lessons and working with new members to help them learn more and be ready for build season.  
**Be Involved.** Often, the best learning experience comes with jumping right into it. With the guidance of more experienced mentors and members, pursue projects and participate in what interests you.  
**Take a look at our team resources.** Our team has collected information that we think is important, and you can find all of that on [our resources page](/resources/).

If you have any scheduling/team questions, you can also check out our [Frequently Asked Questions](/members/faq/) page.

## Workshop Hours

Tracking the time you spend at the workshop is important. Not only is having record of all your hard work and dedication a great college application point, but privileges like eligibilty for our leadership team and competition team all require certain minimum hour requirements. In order to keep track of your hours, follow these steps:
+ When you come to the workshop each day, sign in on the automatic time tracking terminal with your student ID or fingerprint.
+ Before you leave the workshop, make sure to sign out.

## Team Leadership

Our team is led by a group of elected student officials and appointed officers. They meet during weekly Leadership meeting where the leadership, mentors, and project leaders discuss the current happenings of the team. Learn out more about [our leadership team](/about/leaders/).

### Elected Positions

Our President and Viceo President are elected in May by a team vote of all members who have attended meetings for at least 10 build season hours. Anyone who has been on the team for at least one complete build season can self-nominate for President or Vice President, with Presidential candidates selecting their Vice Presidential running mate. The election will follow each Presidential candidate delivering opening and closing statements before and after responses to specific questions submitted by team members and chosen by mentors.

### Appointed Positions

Our leadership team and mentors create appointed positions when needed. Appointed officers are in charge of specific parts of the team that leadership has deemed necessary. These positions are created to fit the various needs of the team, and are subject to change over time. For the 2018-19 season, each of our departments has one appointed Head of Department.
