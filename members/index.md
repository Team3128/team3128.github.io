<!-- Team member applications and selection are complete for the 2023-2024 school year. 
We had many more applicants than spots available, and selection was extremely difficult. <br>

If you applied, emails with acceptance/rejection were sent out at 5:00 PM on **Sunday, Sept. 4, 2023**. <br>

If you applied, but did not receive an email response on Sept. 4 - please contact the Team at [info@team3128.org](mailto:info@team3128.org). <br>

If you received an acceptance email, it included instructions for items that must be completed by **Wednesday Sept. 7, 2022 at 8 PM**, to be rostered with the Team. 
If any prospective member fails to complete rostering by that date, we will assume they are no longer interested, and move on to any waitlisted candidates. -->

## **What Team 3128 wants In a New Member**

**Acceptance criteria for Team 3128:** 
- Ability to work well with other students as a team
- Willingness to learn
- Enthusiasm
- Ability to communicate
- Ability to remain calm under pressure
- Willingness to meet the time commitment
- Be a good person 

These are the primary criteria our Team members will use to rank applicants. Coaches and Mentors may give input, but are not part of the new member selection process (so it's OK to ignore the adults during Narweek). 
 Prior robotics experience is certainly helpful, but not required. Each [department](/about/departments/) has a certain number of available spots, and applicants will be given these spots (based on their ranking) until the department slate is full.

This year, each department has 6 open positions - except for Marketing (4 spots) and Strategy (5 spots).

## **Questions?** 
If you have any questions, feel free to contact our [Presidents or Coaches](/contact/) or email [info@team3128.org](/info@team3128.org/) for more information!

Please do NOT use your student email (xxxx@my.sduhsd.net) to contact Team 3128. Your school email rejects all emails from outside the school, so we cannot reply or contact you.

### Finding the Workshop
Our Workshop is located right under the Learning Commons. There are two ways to get to our workshop:
1. **From the school.** Take the stairs between the B building and the Learning Commons towards the Admin Parking Lot. Our workshop is just past the Nest on the right side of the gate (the fenced-in area).
2. **From the Admin Parking Lot** Our workshop can be accessed by entering the large concrete sidewalk just right of the Administration building. It is the fenced-in area.
