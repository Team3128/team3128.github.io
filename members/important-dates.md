## FRC Build Season

Our Build Season is an exhilarating (and stressful) season to design and build a robot to compete against many other teams in the California Region, and hopefully the World.

**For the 2025-2026 school year, Build Season/Kickoff begins on Saturday, January 10, 2025 at 8:00 AM PST in San Diego, with the game reveal. Attendance for all Team members is mandatory for Kickoff and the 3 days following Kickoff.**

Since the discontinuation of "Bag Day", Build Season will last until the end of our last Competition event - either mid April (last District event) or World Championships in Houston (April 28-May 2, 2026).


## FRC Competition Season

As soon as FIRST releases more information, this section will be updated. Right now, competition season dates begin March 6th, 2026, and will last until a week 6 or week 7 District event (mid April 2026).
