## FRC Build Season

Our Build Season is an exhilarating (and stressful) season to design and build a robot to compete against many other teams in the Southern California area, and hopefully the World.

For the 2022-2023 school year, Build Season/Kickoff begins on Saturday, January 7, 2023 at 10:00 AM Eastern Time (ET), or 7:00 AM PST, with the game reveal. It is highly recommended to come to the kickoff meeting to help plan our robot for the year.
