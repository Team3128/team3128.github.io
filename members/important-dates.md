## Weekly Meetings

This year, our meetings are all currently online and held through Slack, Google Meet, and/or Discord. See our calendar for specific dates!
However, we have just been allowed to meet on the CCA campus in our workshop! Visit the Members page for the Reopening Plan and requirements.
During a normal year, preseason (which runs from fall to the beginning of winter break), our team meets on Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays from 3:00 pm - 6:00 pm to further our skills, work on build projects, plan events, and more. Check out our calendar for specifics.

## Leadership Meetings

Every week, the leadership team holds a meeting where they discuss the happenings of the team and any logistics, events, and changes necessary. For the 2020-2021 year, leadership meetings will happen every Wednesday, immediately following the team meeting at 3:45 pm. Leadership meetings are open to all members of the team.

## FRC Build Season

Our Build Season is an exhilarating (and stressful) season to design and build a robot to compete against many other teams in the Southern California area, and hopefully the World.
For the 2020-2021 school year, Build Season/Kickoff begins on Saturday, January 9, 2021 at 10:30 AM Eastern Time (ET), or 7:30 AM PST, with the game reveal. This year, the game is a repeat of last year, so redesign and modification of last yearâ€™s robot is already underway.

**Normal Scheduled Meetings**
