## Weekly Meetings

Our weekly meetings for the 2023-2024 school year are in person. Our workshop schedule is below, but may be changed due to mentor availability: 

**Monday:** 3:30-6:30 PM

**Tuesday:** 5:00-8:00 PM

**Friday:** 3:30-6:30 PM

Our meeting schedule for Build/Competition Season (Jan-April) is yet to be determined, but will include (probably) Saturday meetings (all day).  If the Team need more workshop time, they must petition the Coaches to open the workshop for additional hours (generally Sundays). Please check the calendar for updates. 

Some departments have different schedules. Please check with your department coordinator for your exact meeting schedule, or see the [calendar](http://team3128.org/members/calendar).

**All members must attend at least 75% of all meetings.**

Leadership meetings are open to all members of the team. Meetings will alternate between in-perons and online via google meet.

## FRC Build Season

Our Build Season is an exhilarating (and stressful) season to design and build a robot to compete against many other teams in the California Region, and hopefully the World.
