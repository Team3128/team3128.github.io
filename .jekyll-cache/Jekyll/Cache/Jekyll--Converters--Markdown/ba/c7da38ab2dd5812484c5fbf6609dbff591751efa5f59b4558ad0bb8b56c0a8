<!-- 
If you are interested in joining the team, come to our **Intro Day** on **September 13th at 3:00pm at the workshop**! The week of September 16th - 20th, our shop will be open every day Monday - Friday for NarWeek, to give members a more extensive introduction to the team and what we do. On Intro Day, each of our five divisions (Mechanical, Controls, Business, Marketing, and Strategy) will be giving a brief introduction of what they do. After Intro Day is NarWeek, where every day we will dive headfirst into all that FRC has to offer, looking at all of the aspects of our team and how our departments work together to make Team 3128 run as best as it can. 
-->

<!--
That said, do not worry if you are joining the team after Intro Day and NarWeek! Simply stop by the workshop on one of our meeting days (Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays after school), find one of our student leaders or mentors, and we will get you started on everything you need to know.
-->
<!--
The process for getting registered with the team is currently being updated, and we will walk you through how to do it once robotics starts back up for the 2019 - 2020 season. The steps for registration will be available in September.

  <li><strong>Sign up on <a href="https://my.firstinspires.org/Dashboard/">STIMS</a>, our league information manager.</strong> This will let you attend tournaments and be involved in official robotics events off-campus. <em>This step requires a parental unit to finish.</em> You can find detailed instructions for <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4NhnLtlTNV6T1ljM0o2Wm9wc28/view">new members here</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4NhnLtlTNV6WGR2Rzk5NXpNbzQ/view">returning members here</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Turn in a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hleaX1rEWXA9QjJedI54hGureuK_zdqZQUVaP21OPQM/edit?usp=sharing">Safety Waiver</a>.</strong> You and your parental unit will need to read, understand, agree to, and sign the safety waiver. Please turn in the physical waiver to a mentor at the workshop.</li>
  <li><strong>Complete <a href="/members/safety/">Team 3128 Safety Training</a>.</strong> Because of the nature of what we do, safety is paramount to our team.

  <li><strong>Review the Team Handbook <a href="/resources/Team3128Handbook.pdf">Team 3128 Handbook</a>.</strong> You will also need both you and your parent to sign the “Code of Conduct Agreement” page, located on the second page of the same document as the Safety Waiver (see Step <!--4-->3).</li>

<p><img src="/assets/page_photos/members/1.jpg" class="leftimage" /></p>

<p><strong>Learn your way around the workshop.</strong> Through various talks and hands-on explanations, mentors and students explain how to use various tools and the various procedures of the team.<br />
<strong>Attend Workshops and Classes,</strong> Throughout preseason, our members and mentors will be giving lessons and working with new members to help them learn more and be ready for build season.<br />
<strong>Be Involved.</strong> Often, the best learning experience comes with jumping right into it. With the guidance of more experienced mentors and members, pursue projects and participate in what interests you.<br />
