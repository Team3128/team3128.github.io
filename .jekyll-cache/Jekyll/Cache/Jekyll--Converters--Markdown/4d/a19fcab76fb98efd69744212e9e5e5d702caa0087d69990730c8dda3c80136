I"<p>Have a question about our robotics program? Here are some of the most often asked questions and our answers to them. If your question is not listed, feel free to shoot us an <a href="/contact/">email</a>.</p>

<p><strong>When does the team meet during the week?</strong></p>

<p>Starting Fall 2019, our team meets Monday, Thursday, and Friday from 3:00 pm - 6:00 pm every week. Our first meeting of the 2019-2020 season will be Intro Day on September 13th. The week of September 16th - 20th, however, we will be meeting every day Monday - Friday to give new members a more extensive introduction to the team and what we do. You can look at <a href="/members/calendar/">our calendar</a> for details.</p>

<p>During Build Season (from January 3rd until our first competition in March), we meet the same days during the week as in pre-season in the Fall, as well as most Saturdays and some Sundays (subject to change based on mentor availability). Specific dates are updated on <a href="/members/calendar/">our calendar</a>.</p>

<p>During Competition Season (February 26 - April 20), we meet as necessary based upon which Competitions we attend. The Travel Team will compete at 2 Regional Competitions (specific events TBD) for the 2020 Competition season. If we are successful at our Regional competitions and we earn a slot, we will also travel to Houston Texas for the <a href="https://www.firstchampionship.org/welcome">FRC World Championships</a>.</p>

<p><strong>What does a robotics team do? What are these competitions like?</strong></p>

<p>The best description of FRC Robotics was recently covered in an “HBO Real Sports” documentary you can view <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18OCZz8yKtU">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Where do you guys meet?</strong></p>

<p>We meet in the Robotics Workshop, which is the gated area right next to the Nest and under the Learning Commons. It is a part of the Administration building.</p>

<p><strong>Is it mandatory that I be at every meeting?</strong></p>

<p>Our team is open to students with a variety of time commitments, and we do not ‘cut’ team members if they can’t come very often. However, there are hour requirements for various privileges such as joining the leadership team, travel team, or being selected for a competition position. These commitments usually require an attendance record of over 70% of standard meeting hours.</p>

<p>Students with limited time must be aware of their availability and act accordingly. Getting involved in build project groups or leadership positions where you hold a key position might not be the wisest decision if you have other responsibilities. However, don’t let that stop you from getting involved at all.</p>

<p><strong>Is it mandatory that I stay for the entire meeting?</strong></p>

<p>Students can come and leave as they like from each meeting. They should make sure to sign in and out with our Timekeeping Tool so that their hours are properly logged. However, most of the time announcements, project logistics, etc, will all happen at the beginning of the meeting. So, if you get there late make sure to talk to a mentor or student to find out what is happening.</p>

<p>If you need to leave early, you are required to clean up your work area prior to leaving.  This is especially true of the Construction and Mechanical Divisions, who make the most use of our Power and Machine Tools (if anyone fails to do this, workshop privileges may be revoked).  Make sure the people you are working with are aware of your departure time. That way all of you can work together to figure out when clean up needs to happen, future plans, etc.</p>

<p><strong>I have a fall sport. Can I be involved?</strong></p>

<p>Students involved in seasonal sports can still be involved during their off-season. For instance, if you are a member of a fall sport which usually ends October/November, you can definitely hop in. Just make sure that you’ve finished our <a href="/members/">Getting Started checklist</a>.</p>

<p>A good rule of thumb is that our most busy time is from November – March. If you sport doesn’t overlap with those months, you definitely can be involved during our main competition season.</p>

<p><strong>I have a sport during competition season. Can I get involved during Fall/Spring?</strong></p>

<p>If you really can’t be a part of the team during the main competition season, you are still welcome to join us during our off-season. We usually have build projects going and different workshops that can teach you valuable information about all sorts of mechanical, electrical, programming, or construction-related skills.</p>

<p><strong>Who goes to your competitions? What are competition positions? Who are they open to?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Travel Team</strong> is made up of the students selected for competition positions. These are different roles that students can interview for if they have met the position requirements. While all students are allowed to join us at our home regional and help us compete, our travel team has very specific positions that are vital to our success.</p>

<p>Interviews for specific, key positions on the travel team are held throughout November, during preseason.  Most travel team positions are selected near the end of build season based on performance during build.</p>

<p>Parents and students not on our travel team are invited to join us at the San  Diego Regional competition, and if we qualify, Houston Championships. It is a great opportunity to meet other teams, get inspired by robots, show your Narwhal pride, and get to know the rest of your team better.</p>
