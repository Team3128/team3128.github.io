I"ï<p>The current Team 3128 website is powered by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, an easy to use but immensely powerful static website creation tool. All of the CSS and layout is done in-house.</p>

<p>Previously, our website was hosted on Wordpress and designed using various custom modified Wordpress themes. In late 2015, our website experienced a complete redesign. The entire website was transferred to be hosted on GitHub, and created from scratch by Ronak R.</p>
