I"|<p>Attending STEM expos and other festivals across San Diego county is one of the ways through which the Aluminum Narwhals can spread FIRST and a love for robotics..</p>

<p>The Aluminum Narwhals have exhibited at Balboa Park’s Maker Faire (2017, 2018) and the Festival of Science and Engineering’s <a href="https://www.lovestemsd.org/expo-day">EXPO Day</a> (2018, 2019). We will not be appearing at EXPO Day 2020.</p>

<p>Our team has also appeared at more local exhibitions, including the SBSD <a href="https://www.sbsd.k12.ca.us/Page/9333">STREAM Fest</a> (2019) and San Diego Hua Xia Chinese School’s Chinese New Year Festival (2020).</p>

<p>A few years ago, we attended the Qualcomm QKids event (2016), where Qualcomm invites local STEM organizations to come and present in personalized booths while elementary-middle school students of Qualcomm employees enjoy the activities held by the various exhibitors. Our team is able to further raise awareness of FIRST and promote our annual robotics summer camp designed to inspire a passion for STEM in children. Find out more about our summer camp <a href="team3128.org/camp">here</a>.</p>
