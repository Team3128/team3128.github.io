I"Á<p>Just as a quick introduction, my name is Sarah C. I joined the 3128 Aluminum Narwhals FRC regional and travel team this year. My experience so far has consisted of a car ride full of puns and excitement for the Vegas Regional competition ahead.</p>

<p>I am looking forward to talking with the Judges and other FRC robotics teams. I particularly find it interesting to compare the different ways teams will interpret the best strategies to succeed in this yearâ€™s 2016: Monty Python themed game. Some of the aspects of the travel team that I will probably, remember and enjoy the most will be bonding with my room mates and exploring the crazy, fast paced city of Las Vegas.</p>

<p>Wish us luck!</p>
