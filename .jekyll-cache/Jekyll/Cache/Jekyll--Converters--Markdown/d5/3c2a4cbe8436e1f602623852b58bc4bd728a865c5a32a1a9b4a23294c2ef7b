I"_<p>We work with a lot of cool tools and hardware on our team, and while these enable us to be able to create awesome things, they also pose a risk if not used properly. In order to ensure that we can continue pursuing our wildest dreams and craziest ambitions, we require all members to complete basic safety training.</p>

<h2 id="safety-training">Safety Training</h2>
<p>Note that these steps do not allow you to start using power tools, but these are <strong>required</strong> for entry and use of the workshop. 
<!--Returning members must complete training **by September 7th, 2020** and new members must complete training **by October 9th, 2020**.
