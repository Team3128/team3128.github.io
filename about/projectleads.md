Our team has sub-team leaders that work closely with the Division coordinators to maintain the technical aspects of Team 3128. They oversee the design, fabrication, and controls aspect of the robot, train the next generation of narwhals, and oversee major departmental projects. 
<!--For the 2021-2022 season, our team will have Project Leader positions in addition to the Division Coordinators. <!--- Any member may seek self-nominations for a specific Project Lead position within their Division. Project leaders will work closely with their corresponding division coordinator in managing the progress of the certain project he or she is in charge of. Some responsibilies of a project leader may include planning, attending and/or documenting project meetings. In the case that the division coordinator is unable to attend a meeting, project leads may also be able to serve as a proxy. --->
<!---
If members have any projects they are interested in leading, they should reach out to the leadership team and their respective department coordinator! --->
