For the 2021-2022 season, our team will have Project Leader positions in addition to the Division Coordinators. <!--- Any member may seek self-nominations for a specific Project Lead position within their Division. --->Project leaders will work closely with their corresponding division coordinator in managing the progress of the certain project he or she is in charge of. Some responsibilies of a project leader may include planning, attending and/or documenting project meetings. In the case that the division coordinator is unable to attend a meeting, project leads may also be able to serve as a proxy. 
<!---
If members have any projects they are interested in leading, they should reach out to the leadership team and their respective department coordinator! --->
