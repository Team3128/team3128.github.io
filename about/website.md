The current Team 3128 website is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), an easy to use but immensely powerful static website creation tool. All of the CSS and layout is done in-house.

Previously, our website was hosted on Wordpress and designed using various custom modified Wordpress themes. In late 2015, our website experienced a complete redesign. The entire website was transferred to be hosted on GitHub, and created from scratch by Ronak R.
