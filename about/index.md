Team 3128 Aluminum Narwhals is a high school robotics team at Canyon Crest Academy in San Diego, California. 

### Our History
Our team was founded in September of 2009 at Canyon Crest Academy in San Diego, California, at a school where math, science, and technology were valued, but hadn’t found a way to be manifested yet. A handful of students, one engineering mentor, and a computer programming teacher felt those values were important – and thus the Aluminum Narwhals were born.

Our robotics team, along with several others found at our school, participates in a non-profit program known as FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) in the high school division known as FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) as well as another division known as FTC (First Tech Challenge). Founded in 1992 by inventor Dean Kamen, FIRST has quickly grown to be a worldwide, prestigious, competitive robotics experience for all ages. Between the elementary level FIRST Lego League division (FLL), FTC and FRC, thousands of students and adults participate in competitions across the globe each year, culminating in a large championship competition currently held in St. Louis, Missouri.

During the 2010 competition season, our team entered brand new and won the Rookie All-Star award for our stellar performance despite being a first-year team, landing us a spot in the FRC World Competition.

We grew for the next 9 years, developing our [Robotics Summer Camp](/camp/), a week-long session for students grades 1 through 8 to design, build, and program their very own robots over the summer.

Our hard work and drive only grew stronger over the course of our team's history. With the culmination of enthusiastic mentors' support, skilled drive, mechanical, strategy, electronics, programming, and outreach teams, we began to develop a program that could effectively build upon our past exeperiences and pass down our success to the future generations of narwhals. As we grew, we made sure to keep true to our roots, developing a culture that celebrates all of our members' and allows for the development of new ideas. Over the Aluminum Narwhals' first decade, we've gone further than we could have ever imagined, accomplishing several awards, including Entrepreneurship, Innovation in Controls, Regional Finalist, Championship Subdivision Finalist, multiple Dean's List Finalists, and Engineering Inspiration.
