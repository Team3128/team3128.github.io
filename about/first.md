For Recognition and Inspiration of Science and Technology, or FIRST, is a program founded in 1989 by Dean Kamen. Creator of the Segway, Kamen wanted to create a program that brings students together to build and compete with robots. “I want to compete for the hearts and minds of kids with the excitement of the Super Bowl,” said Kamen. And he has. With 4 programs spanning from kindergarten to high school, over 1 million students per year build robots with their teams and build a sense of cooperative competition - coopertition.
